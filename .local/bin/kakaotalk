## Kakaotalk through Wine
# Packages: wine winetricks wine-gecko wine-mono
# - Check cache folder
# 	* ~/.cache/wine
# 	* ~/.cache/winetricks
# env: WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX= # win32 sucks
# - CORRECT WAY
# 	1. winecfg
# 	2. Libraries: gdiplus msxml6 riched20 riched32 winhttp wmp
# 	3. winetricks cjkfonts
# - NOT WORKING! WINARCH=win32 winetricks cjkfonts riched20 riched30 richtx32 gdiplus wmp9 winhttp dotnet20 # dotnet45 is broken in wine-6.0?
